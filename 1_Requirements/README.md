## MPPT CHARGE CONTROLLER

MPPT Charge Controller achieves MPP through DC-DC optimizers and localized control of panel voltage and current can also be achieved, and each panel operates at its independent maximum power point (MPP), thus improving the energy extraction of the overall system. The series connection of the outputs provides an inherent voltage stacking that enables each DC-DC converter to operate at a relatively low voltage conversion ratio (enabling high conversion efficiency), while still achieving high overall output voltage, which is desirable as it enables the use of a central, high-voltage, high-efficiency inverter. Figure 2.2 depicts the block diagram of the MPPT Charge Controller. This block diagram mainly consists of five parts. 
    This includes 
      - Current Sensor 
	    - Voltage Sensor
	    - Buck Converter
	    - Arduino UNO
	    - Battery
